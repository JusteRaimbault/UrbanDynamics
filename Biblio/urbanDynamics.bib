	Abstract = {Although the disaggregation of consumers is crucial in understanding the fragmented markets that are dominant in many developed countries, it is not always straightforward to carry out such disaggregation within conventional retail modelling frameworks due to the limitations of data. In particular, consumer grouping based on sampled data is not assured to link with the other statistics that are vital in estimating sampling biases and missing variables in the sampling survey. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a useful combination of spatial interaction modelling and microsimulation approaches for the reliable estimation of retail interactions based on a sample survey of consumer behaviour being linked with other areal statistics. We demonstrate this approach by building an operational retail interaction model to estimate expenditure flows from households to retail stores in a local city in Japan, Kusatsu City.},

	Abstract = {This chapter describes a dynamic spatial microsimulation model which is applicable for small geographical areas across Great Britain. The model is capable of providing insights into not only the demographic, social and economic structure of areas but also the behaviour patterns of residents. The data, software and computational requirements of this project are discussed in some detail. We argue that the underlying procedures are sophisticated, computationally demanding and intellectually challenging but that the rewards are significant. The value of the resulting applications is illustrated with reference to a range of substantive domains, ranging from health services, transportation and crime to requirements for housing and other physical infrastructure. Some major elements of an ongoing agenda for research into the enhancement of dynamic spatial MSM are suggested. More progress is needed in the assessment and interpretation of model results, which means better techniques for model validation and more work on the social processes through which model users may be engaged. It is also argued that greater value can be extracted from a combination of more abundant data, and the refinement of modelling methods, in respect of which the possibilities for the incorporation of agent-based models, is particularly noted.},
